# Password-Generator

Here I created a working code to generate a password of 8-128 characters with a random merge of symbols, numbers, Uppercase and Lowercase letters. Code in Javascript contains arrrys for the various elements of the password,and for loop. Here I introduced a concat function to merge/join two or more arrays to get a random mix for a generated password.
